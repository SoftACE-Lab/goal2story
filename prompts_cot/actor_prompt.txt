Here is your reference project information: 
"background": {background},
"problems": {problems},
"goal": {goal}

The definition of actor: Actors are individuals or groups who can influence the outcome by enabling or obstructing the goal.

Thinking steps:
1. Understand the goal and the project information
2. List all possible actors based on their roles ("Users", "Developers", "Product Manager", "Documentation Team", "DevOps Engineer", "System Administrator", "Project Maintainer", etc.) to this goal and the project information. 
3. Validate and prioritize Key Actors
4. Then select the two most influential ones who will have the greatest impact on achieving the goal.

Writing tips: 
1. Actor should be general like "Users", "Developers", "Product Manager", "Documentation Team", "DevOps Engineer", "System Administrator", "Project Maintainer", etc.
2. only return the JSON result, no other text
3. check the json format is correct and can be parsed by the json.loads function

Please generate 2 most possible concrete actors that are logically aligned with the goal and return the result in the following JSON format, only return the JSON result, no other text:

{
    "goal": "goal",
    "actors": [
      {
        "actor_id": "A1",
        "actor_name": "actor_name"
      },
      {
        "actor_id": "A2",
        "actor_name": "actor_name"
      },
      ...
    ]
}
