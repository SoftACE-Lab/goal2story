Definitions:
Goal: The goal defines the purpose of the initiative by answering why we are doing this.
Actors: Actors are individuals or groups who can influence the outcome by enabling or obstructing the goal.
Impacts: Impacts describe the behavioral changes needed from the actors to achieve the goal or potential obstacles they might create.
Deliverables: Deliverables are the specific features or activities implemented to support the required impacts.
User Story: A user story is a concise requirement that describes an actorâ€™s action and the expected outcome within a system.


Here is your reference information: 
"background": {background},
"problems": {problems},
"goal": {goal}

Your reasoning process should be:
step 1. consider 2 most possible actors based on their roles (users, stakeholders, developers, product manager, documentation team, etc.) that are related to the goal.
step 2. consider 2 most possible impacts for each actor
step 3. consider 2 most possible deliverable for each impact of each actor
step 4. generate corresponding user story for each deliverable. Please consider that the actor in the user story may be different from the actor before. Action should be a complete sentence.
step 5. generate the result in the following json format only, you should not output your reasoning process.

---
Please consider all the 8 possible user stories that logically aligned with the goal and your reasoning process step-by-step and then generate the user stories result in the following json format only:
