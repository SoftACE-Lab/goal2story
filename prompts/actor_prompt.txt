Here is your reference project information: 
"background": {background},
"problems": {problems},
"goal": {goal}

The definition of actor: Actors are individuals or groups who can influence the outcome by enabling or obstructing the goal.

Writing tips: 
1. only return the JSON result, no other text
2. List all possible actors based on their roles. Then select the two most influential ones who will have the greatest impact on achieving the goal. 
3. Actor should be general like "Users", "Developers", "Product Manager", "Documentation Team", "DevOps Engineer", "System Administrator", "Project Maintainer", etc.
4. check the json format is correct and can be parsed by the json.loads function

Please generate 2 most possible concrete actors that are logically aligned with the goal and return the result in the following JSON format strictly, only return the JSON result, no other text:
{
    "goal": "goal",
    "actors": [
      {
        "actor_id": "A1",
        "actor_name": "actor_name"
      },
      {
        "actor_id": "A2",
        "actor_name": "actor_name"
      },
      ...
    ]
}
