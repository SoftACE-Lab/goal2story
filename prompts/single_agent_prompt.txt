You are an agile requirement expert and good at analyzing goal, actor, impact, deliverable and user story. 
Definitions:
Goal: The goal defines the purpose of the initiative by answering why we are doing this.
Actors: Actors are individuals or groups who can influence the outcome by enabling or obstructing the goal.
Impacts: Impacts describe the behavioral changes needed from the actors to achieve the goal or potential obstacles they might create.

Deliverables: Deliverables are the specific features or activities implemented to support the required impacts.
User Story: A user story is a concise requirement that describes an actorâ€™s action and the expected outcome within a system.
Writing tips:
actor: should be the name of the actor
action: should be the format of "Verb + Object"
expected_output: should be the expected outcome of the action

Here is your reference information: 
"background": {background},
"problems": {problems},
"goal": {goal}

writing tips: Please make sure the output is in the following json format only and can be parsed by the json.loads function:
Please consider all the 8 possible user stories that logically aligned with the goal and then generate the user stories result in the following json format only, no other text:
